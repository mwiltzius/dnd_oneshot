        dragonborn: "Nobody can remember a time when the dragonborn did not walk the earth. According to their own histories, they were created to tend the earth, just as the dragons were created to tend the heavens. As a consequence of this belief, the dragonborn possess an empire spanning many other races, which they rule over. The dragonborn themselves seldom leave the empire except for matters of state. However, some dragonborn can be found beyond the borders, sometimes as adventurers, and other times as exiles. </p><br><p> The dragonborn live in a strict caste system, with each 'clan', each composed of one of the many metallic colors. These clans claim to share power equally, but in truth each vies for the emperor's seat, and when they cannot get it, his favor. </p><br></p> The chromatic dragonborn, however, are not so lucky. Viewed as 'fake' or faded, these dragonborn occupy the lowest rung of society, even below the other races that live among them.",
        dwarf: 'Dwarves come in all kinds of varieties, and can be found just about anywhere there is work to be done. Most prefer the cool dampness of a life under the surface, though others choose to live among the other races, usually humans or gnomes. To an outsider, the dwarven perspective on society may seem strange; instead of organizing themselves into kingdoms or empires, they belong the clans strewn about the various cities and communities in which they live. A dwarf\'s duty is to the clan, and it is the clan that carriers out punishment for misdeeds. One might think that such a system might breed chaos, but the dwarves have been without any major war or conflict among themselves for centuries. Some accuse the dwarves of being the profiteers of war, rather than to stand up for any kind of righteous cause - however, such accusations are usually drowned out by the exchange of a few coins. </p><br><p> A typical dwarf can be expected to live for about a century and a half, should he be lucky enough to die of natural causes.',
        elf: 'Though it has been a millenium since the first recorded histories, the elves carry an oral tradition from far before that time, speaking of an era when the gods themelves led their kingdoms into greatness. There are multiple elven kingdoms that dot the world, most of which isolate themselves from the others. Despite this aversion to their fellows, not all kingdoms are hostile to non-elves living inside their borders, some even permitting other races to hold positions of rank and privlidge. Nevertheless, any type of social mixing is generally discouraged - a notable exception being the Kingdom of Suver, where a half-elf sits on the throne. </p><br><p> Elves live for hundreds of years, which many schollars point to as a cause for their rich cultures and ancient traditions - however, it is also said that this makes them slow to adapt to an ever-changing world. A proud people, it is sometimes said that any two elves will agree on everything except what the other said first.',
        gnome: 'One who does not understand gnomes will be quick to underestimate them. Although a singe gnome may seem like an easy adversary, a single gnome is rarely just that. The gnomish people are quick and quicker-witted, a power made even more potent by their uncanny ability to cooperate with each other. Gnomes do not live in divided kingdoms, but rather see themselves as one people living across the world. Despite multiple attempts, there has been no recorded occasion of a non-gnome gaining entry to a gnomish community - much less discover where one is located. What is known is that a gnome can seems to appear just as quickly as he disappeared, sometimes miles from where he was last seen. <p><br><p> Gnomes live shorter lives than other mortal species, reaching maturity in seven years time, and passing no more than two or three decades later.',
        halfelf: 'In past generations, a living half-elf was a marvel to behold, for its existence was a contravention of fate itself. To many elves, they were living proof of a crime against nature, and as such most were aborted, or killed soon after birth. Although this trend is no longer common law among the various elven peoples, there are still those in the older generation who would wish for the old ways to return. As a consequence of this discrimination, many half-elves choose to live among humans, where if not for their longer life span they would be difficult to recognize. Others still choose to sojourn to Suver, an ancient elven kingdom that had embraced the mixing of these races, considering the result superior to either original lineage. Rather than consider themsleves "half" of another race, the people of Suver consider themselves Siel. </p><br><p> Half elves live almost twice as long as humans, often living into their early hundreds. The oldest known half-elf lived to be 211 years old. Typically, a half-elf is born to an elven mother and human father, though exceptions are known to exist.',
        halfling: 'Unlike the other races, halflings to to not endeavor to build great empires or to defeat great evils. Instead, they most often turn their ambitions to affairs of the community, concerning themselves with the general welfare of their neighbors. Let it not be said, however, that halflings are neither passionate nor capable - indeed, when one puts his or her mind to something, any attempt to stop them should be considered a hopeless endeavor. </p><br><p> Halflings typically have a lifespan shy of a century, though some have been known to make it past that mark. It has been speculated that this is a characteristic of their lifestyle, however, rather than their blood.',
        halforc: "To an outsider, any distinction to be made between an orc and a half-orc is meaningless. They look like orcs, are raised by orcs, and behave like orcs. However, this reduction gives the race little justice. Within their tribes, half-orcs are known to be excellent strategists, which often more than makes up for their lesser strength. On rare occasion, half-orcs a raised by a human parent instead, although they are frequently subject to discrimination. Some half-orcs in this situation may appeal to Ko-Shaabok, a spirit that will gift them with a human appearence. This always comes with some kind of price, however, unique to the half-orc who asks for the service.",
        human: "It's pretty much the same as in the player's handbook. They're everywhere, do everything, and breed like rabbits. They also live as long as humans, but actually a bit shorter because there are no vaccines in this universe.",
        tiefling: "The origin of the tiefling is poorly understood, and is subject to much debate among scholars. They are few and have no kingdoms of their own, often opting to live in small communities where they are permitted to go about their lives without interuption. Most commonly found under the jurisdiction of one of the dragonborn clans, most tieflings enjoy equal status with the other mortal races, though they still usually prefer to keep to themselves. </p><br><p> Although most tieflings are the children of the same race, on occasion one might be born a child of another couple. When this happens, they are usually delivered to an elder of a tiefling community for adption, although some parents still choose to raise their tiefling child themselves."
